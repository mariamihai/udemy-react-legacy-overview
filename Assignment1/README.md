# React Assignment 1
This is part of the legacy course which has been redone in April 2021.

The current project is part of the "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

The project is my implementation of the first assignment, **Section 3: Assignment 1 - The Base Syntax**.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-react-overview).

## Implementation
The requirements are:
1. Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
2. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
3. Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
5. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
6. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
8. Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
9. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
10. Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets

## Status
**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the assignment, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
