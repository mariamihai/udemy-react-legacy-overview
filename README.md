# Http project
This is part of the legacy course which has been redone in April 2021.

The current project is part of the "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Contains the implementation done for Section 9 - "Reaching out to the Web (Http / Ajax)".

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-react-overview).

## Implementation
The current project simulates a blog, using axios for GETting, POSTing and DELETing posts.

## Status
<del>**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the assignment, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.</del>
