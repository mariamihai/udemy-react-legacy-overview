# React Assignment 3
This is part of the legacy course which has been redone in April 2021.

The current project is part of the "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

The project is my implementation of the second assignment, **Section 11: Assignment 3 - Routing**.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-react-overview).

## Implementation
The requirements are:
1. Add Routes to load "Users" and "Courses" on different pages (by entering a URL, without Links)
2. Add a simple navigation with two links => One leading to "Users", one leading to "Courses"
3. Make the courses in "Courses" clickable by adding a link and load the "Course" component in the place of "Courses" (without passing any data for now)
4. Pass the course ID to the "Course" page and output it there
5. Pass the course title to the "Course" page - pass it as a param or score bonus points by passing it as query params (you need to manually parse them though!)
6. Load the "Course" component as a nested component of "Courses"
7. Add a 404 error page and render it for any unknown routes
8. Redirect requests to /all-courses to /courses (=> Your "Courses" page)

## Status
**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the assignment, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
